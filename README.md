# De-Samaadhan: Decentralized Complaint Management System

## Overview
De-Samaadhan is a decentralized complaint management system designed to provide a secure and transparent platform for handling complaints. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies and a decentralized architecture, De-Samaadhan ensures anonymity and reliability in managing complaints effectively.

## Technology Stack
- **User Authentication:** Aadhaar Anon
- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Blockchain Integration:** Solidity, Polygon
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS Pinata

## Key Features Implemented
1) **Secure User Authentication**: Utilizing Aadhaar Anon for user authentication ensures secure and anonymous access to the platform, protecting user privacy while maintaining the integrity of the complaint management process.

2) **Automated Complaint Handling**: Utilize smart contracts to automate complaint management processes, ensuring transparency and accountability in sectors like taxation and public services.

3) **IPFS-Powered File Storage**: Complaint-related documents and evidence are stored securely on IPFS using Pinata, ensuring reliable and decentralized storage while maintaining accessibility and integrity.

4) **Citizen-Controlled Access**: Empower citizens to track their complaints regarding taxation, online tax portals, and public services, and receive updates throughout the resolution process.

5) **Immutable Record Keeping**: Utilize blockchain technology to create an unalterable record of complaint-related events, ensuring integrity and authenticity across various sectors.


## Challenges Faced

During the development of De-Samaadhan, we encountered several challenges:

1) **Polygon Testnet Downtime**: The Polygon testnet server experienced downtime, resulting in difficulties in testing and integrating our solution with the Polygon network.

2) **Deprecated Aadhaar Anon Package**: The Aadhaar Anon package we initially intended to use was deprecated, tried to use it with older supported libraries but still faced errors.

3) **Complexity of Smart Contract Mappings**: Understanding and implementing smart contract mappings for sending and fetching data from IPFS proved to be challenging. We had to invest significant time and effort to ensure seamless data exchange between the blockchain and IPFS.

4) **Difficulty in Data Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypting and decrypting data for transmission to and from IPFS presented difficulties due to the complexity of cryptographic algorithms. Overcoming this hurdle required thorough research and experimentation to implement robust encryption mechanisms.


## Future Enhancements

  
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Integrating advanced analytics tools to provide insights into complaint trends, enabling proactive measures to address systemic issues and improve service delivery.

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Expanding platform accessibility through mobile applications to cater to a wider user base and enhance user convenience.

- **Community Governance**: Implementing decentralized governance mechanisms to empower users in decision-making processes and foster a sense of ownership and accountability within the community.
